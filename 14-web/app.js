//How the web works



//Intro

//https requests are the main way we interact with the web using JS


//networks and the internet

//a network is a set of computers that can intercommunicate
//the internet is a big network made up of smaller local networks
//the world wide web is the global system of websites and webpages


//ip addresses

//an ip address is a unique address to find that computer on the network


//DNS

//hostnames are nicknames for servers
//DNS - Domain Name System
//DNS servers resolve host names into IP addresses


//URL anatomy

//URL - Universal resource locator
//URLS have a protocol (http), hostname (site.com), port (80), resource (/some/page.html), query (?x=1)
//server has 65,535 unique ports
//http is port 80, https is port 443
//query specifies extra information


//HTTPS

//When a url is followed, a request is sent to a server and the server responds
//HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol - a set of rules for how a browser communicates with a web server


//Requests and responses

//


//Multiple requests 


//GET vs POST

//GET and POST are request methods that indicate a different action from the browser
//GET requests are requests that dont attempt to change server data 
//POST requests are requests that do attempt to change server data
